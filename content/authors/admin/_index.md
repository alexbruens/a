Alex is a Research Associate at the [National Counterterrorism, Innovation, Technology, and Education Center (NCITE)](https://www.unomaha.edu/ncite/index.php) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. They earned their Ph.D. from the University of Arizona in 2024.

Their Ph.D. research examines United Nations (UN) peacekeeping and political interventions in civil wars; as well as the myriad non-governmental and state actors working alongside the United Nations in development and peacebuilding after civil wars. They investigate the effect of these interventions on violent and non-violent state repression during and after civil conflicts.

For over three years, Alex was a Research Manager on a National Science Foundation-funded project with PIs [Dr. Susanna Campbell](https://www.susannacampbell.com) and [Dr. Jessica Maves Braithwaite](https://www.jessicamaves.com) -- _Networks of Influence and Support in Peace Operations_. This project captures hundreds of thousands of relationships among over 10,000 international and national organizations which engage in peace, humanitarian, and development work in 20 countries with UN peace operations. In this role, Alex has worked with a large, diverse team of over 30 undergraduate and graduate research assistants, with multiple papers in progress coauthored with the PIs ([1]({{< relref "/project/noi_agendasettingpaper" >}}), [2]({{< relref "/project/noi_cooperationcontestation" >}})). The project is based in the [Research on International Policy Implementation Lab (RIPIL)](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil/) at American University.

Alex attended the [Institute for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research (IQMR)](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/center-for-qualitative-and-multi-method-inquiry/institute-for-qualitative-multi-method-research) in 2023 and participated in the Bridging the Gap [New Era Workshop](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/programs/new-era/) in 2022.

Alex holds two bachelor’s degrees from Florida Atlantic University and a master’s degree from the University of Arizona.
