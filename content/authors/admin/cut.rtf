\f0\fs24 \cf0 They aim to elucidate causes and consequences of Special Political Missions (SPMs) explicitly, as the UN has transitioned away from large-scale Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs) over the past decade. Conflict-affected states are characterized by violent and non-violent repression, and PKOs are known to reduce the severity of this repression; are SPMs just as effective? Furthermore, every UN intervention is supported by a number of actors networked through mandates, projects, and informal ties -- how do these networks condition the effect of peace operations on state repression? They address a gap in the literature on international interventions in conflict and state repression, as it posits conflicting theories and findings.\

Alex's research agenda allows for multiple pathways to examine networks around specific international non-governmental organizations, investigate efficacy of international collaboration tools like those used by the United Nations, and understand dyadic state cooperation in the context of great powers politics. Furthermore, the role of international human rights organizations is largely overlooked in the peacebuilding and development environment; I hope to pursue this line of questioning further. In terms of state repression, I will continue to contribute to a burgeoning literature on non-violent repression of civil society and restrictions on non-governmental organizations by applying underutilized data on these restrictions.}
